# Off-chain Rollup Verifier

This project implements an off-chain transaction rollup system with on-chain verification. It allows clients to sign transactions for off-chain execution, stores proofs on-chain, and tallies the total cost for later on-chain expensing.

## Features

- Client-side transaction signing
- Server-side off-chain execution
- On-chain proof storage
- Cost tallying for off-chain tracking
- On-chain expense verification

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/offchain-rollup-verifier.git
   cd offchain-rollup-verifier
   ```

2. Build the Docker environment:
   ```
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

3. Run the Docker environment:
   ```
   ./scripts/run.sh
